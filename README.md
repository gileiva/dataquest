# DataQuest


A trivia game written in Python by Gi Leiva. The game generates questions and answers from different datasets with general information, using the Pandas and Numpy libraries.

> "This is my first project in Python and was initially coded with basic knowledge of the language. As I progress in my Python Backend & Data Science career there will be updates accordingly.
The ultimate goal is to achieve a game that uses multiple datasets to generate questions and answers on various topics
I await your feedback! 
Thanks. Gi"
